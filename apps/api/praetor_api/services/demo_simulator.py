"""Demo-mode workflow simulator.

Drives an in-memory workflow run forward over time, emitting realistic
agentic events as it goes. The shape mirrors what a real run produces so
the existing UI components render naturally.

The simulator is reached through `demo_workflows.run_workflow`. Tests can
call `tick_run` directly with a zero-delay sleep callable for instant
completion.
